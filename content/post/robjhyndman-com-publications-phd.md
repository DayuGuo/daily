  This thesis considers continuous time autoregressive processes defined by stochastic differential equations and develops some methods for modelling time series data by such processes.
  The first part of the thesis looks at continuous time linear autoregressive (CAR) processes defined by linear stochastic differential equations. These processes are well-understood and there is a large body of literature devoted to their study. I summarise some of the relevant material and develop some further ...
