  <p>Sean Talts and Bob Carpenter pointed us to this awesome MCMC animation site by Chi Feng. For instance, here&#8217;s NUTS on a banana-shaped density. This is indeed super-cool, and maybe there&#8217;s a way to connect these with Stan/ShinyStan/Bayesplot so as to automatically make movies of Stan model fits. This would be great, both to help [&#8230;]</p>
