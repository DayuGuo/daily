description: "The official guidelines for the M4 competition have now been published,
  and there have been several developments since my last post on this.\n There is
  now a prize for prediction interval accuracy using a scaled version of the Mean
  Interval Score. If the $100(1-\\alpha)$% prediction interval for time $t$ is given
  by $[L_{t},U_{t}]$, for $t=1,\\dots,h$, then the MIS is defined as $$\\frac{1}{h}\\sum_{t=1}^{h}
  \\left[ (U_t-L_t) + \\frac{2}{\\alpha}(L_t-Y_t)1(Y_t &lt; L_t) + \\frac{2}{\\alpha}(Y_t-U_t)1(Y_t "
