description: "<p>Susan, a friend of mine, comes from Germany. One day, she asked me,excitedly:
  &lsquo;I heard that <em>Germany</em> in Chinese means <em>a Land of Virtue</em>.
  Is that true?&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;True.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;DEGUO, Country
  of Virtue.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;I love Chinese! Tell me more. What is <em>France</em>
  in Chinese?&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ndash; &lsquo;FAGUO, Legal Country.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Hm,
  it makes sense. How about <em>America</em>?&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ndash; &lsquo;MEIGUO, "
