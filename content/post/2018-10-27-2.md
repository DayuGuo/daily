  Introduction It’s been a busy 12 months but with the Geocomputation with R book nearing completion1 I’ve finally found some time to update my blog and do a bit of thinking, about the tangled topic of line aggregation.
   Why aggregate lines? The transport ‘flow’ on any particular segment of the transport networks is the aggregate (sum) of trips that pass through it1. Finding the flow across a transport network based on input data composed of individual routes, is therefore an aggregation problem.
