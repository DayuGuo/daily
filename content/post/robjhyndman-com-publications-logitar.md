  models and then developing generalizations of them which allow nonparametric additive
  covariates. I show that several apparently different binary AR(1) models are equivalent.
  Three possible nonparametric additive regression models which allow for autocorrelation
  are considered; one is a generalization of an ARX model, the other two are generalizations
  of a regression model with AR errors. One of the models is applied to two data sets:
