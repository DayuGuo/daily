          <p>My friend Miao is going to finish his postdoctoral research in Waterloo this summer. Currently he is looking for a new postdoc position in the US (no particular preference over the location in US). I&rsquo;m trying to help him here because usually I love helping talents who are not widely known (of course, famous people won&rsquo;t need my help, either).</p>

  <p>Miao&rsquo;s background is environmental science, about which I know nothing, but we do have one strong interest in common:
