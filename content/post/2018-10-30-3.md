description: 'Scenario 1: from spreadsheet to reprex So, you’ve been asked to make
  a reprex and you want to include a bit of data that you have in a spreadsheet.1
  Meet {datapasta}, a package by Miles McBain that can make your life a whole lot
  easier. Once you’ve installed datapasta, you simply copy a selected number of rows
  from your spreadsheet (remember, this is a minimal reproducible example), and click
  the Paste as tribble option from the DATAPASTA section of the Addins dropdown.'
