  Jo-fai Chow’s rPlotter is described as “[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners.” I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as “another” colour-palette generator for R.1 To be specific, I was drawn in by Palette Tarantino, which you can catch the code for in Chow’s post, Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator.
  rPlotter-generated colour palettes for: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Django Unchained
