description: <p>R, as I’ve pointed out before, has a package discovery problem.</p><p>There’s
  a new package, <a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr">colorblindr</a>,
  which lets you see the impact of various sorts of colour-blindness on a colour palette,
  a very useful thing for designing good graphics. When it’s mentioned on Twitter,
  you see lots of people glad that such a tool is now available for R. </p><p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dichromat/index.html">A
  similar tool</a> has been available on CRAN for fifteen years. </p><p>Now, the new
  package looks to have a better representation of colour vision. The dichromat package
  used colour-matching experiments from the 1990s and interpolates with loess; colorblindr
  seems to have a unified colour model.   It would be nice to see a comparison of
  the two packages, and maybe it would show everyone should move to the new one. 
  That’s what’s happened to a lot of my contributions to R. Progress is good.</p><p>But
  my point right now is there are a lot of people excited about colorblindr who didn’t
  know dichromat existed. Most of these are people who would have been interested
  in dichromat but didn’t know about it.  I haven’t exactly been quiet about the package
  &ndash;for example, it’s in the R courses that Ken Rice and I teach around the world,
  and I wrote about it for the ASA Computing and Graphics newletter.  It’s not hard
  to get me to talk about color spaces; some people would say it’s hard to get me
  to stop.</p><p>CRAN Task Views have helped a bit with the package discovery problem
  &ndash; but dichromat is in the Graphics task view. It helps if a popular package
  suggests yours &ndash; but dichromat is a dependency of a dependency of ggplot2.
  It helps if the package author is reasonably well known or the package was on CRAN
  early &ndash; but again. It would help to give a clearer name, perhaps?</p><p>There
  must be lots of people out there who would be excited to find there was a package
  doing just what they needed. But there isn’t an easy way for them to notice. <br/></p>
