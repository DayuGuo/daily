description: I consider continuous time autoregressive (CAR) processes of order p
  and develop estimators of the model parameters based on Yule&ndash;Walker type equations.
  For continuously recorded data, it is shown that these estimators are least squares
  estimators and have the same asymptotic distribution as maximum likelihood estimators.
  In practice, though, data can only be observed discretely. For discrete data, I
  consider approximations to the continuous time estimators. It is shown that some
  of these discrete time estimators are asymptotically ...
