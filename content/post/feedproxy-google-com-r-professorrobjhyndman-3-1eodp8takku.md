title: Optimal non-negative forecast reconciliation

description: The sum of forecasts of a disaggregated time series are often required
  to equal the forecast of the aggregate. The least squares solution for finding coherent
  forecasts uses a reconciliation approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya
  et al (2019). The MinT approach and its variants do not guarantee that the coherent
  forecasts are non-negative, even when all of the original forecasts are non-negative
  in nature. This has become a serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative
  such as with sales data or tourism numbers.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRobJ
