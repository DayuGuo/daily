  <p>So. For awhile now we&#8217;ve moved away from the uniform (or, worse, inverse-gamma!) prior distributions for hierarchical variance parameters. We&#8217;ve done half-Cauchy, folded t, and other options; now we&#8217;re favoring unit half-normal. We also have boundary-avoiding priors for point estimates, so that in 8-schools-type problems, the posterior mode won&#8217;t be zero. Something like the gamma(2) [&#8230;]</p>
