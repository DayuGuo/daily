  Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as &ldquo;coherence&rdquo;. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent.
  The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requ
