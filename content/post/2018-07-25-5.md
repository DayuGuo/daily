        <p>My notes during learning about implementing multithreading within c++.</p>
  <div id="openmp" class="section level2">
  <h2>OpenMP</h2>
  <p>use -fopenmp in compilation to enable it. later gcc usually support it example:</p>
  <pre class="c"><code>g++ tmp.cpp -fopenmp</code></pre>
  <p>OpenMP uses <code>#pragma xxxx</code> to support parallelization, the benefit is that the programme can be compiled and get the same result when the compiler does not support it, they will be ignored.</p>
