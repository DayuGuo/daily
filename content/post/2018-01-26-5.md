          <p>One little interesting programming habit I developed a few years ago was to <code>stop()</code> or <code>return()</code> as early as possible in a function. The main reason for this is to reduce the number of lines of code and white spaces for indentation. A few quick examples (for illustration purposes only):</p>

  <pre><code class="language-r">sqrt2 = function(x) {
    if (x &gt;= 0) {
      sqrt(x)
    } else {
      stop(&quot;x must be non-negative&quot;)
    }
  }
  </code></pre>
