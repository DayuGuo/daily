description: <p>If you have a thing with lots of indices, such as a fourth-order sampling
  probability $\pi_{ijk\ell}$ (the probability that individuals $i$, $j$, $k$ and
  $\ell$ are all sampled), there will likely be scenarios where it has lots and lots
  of symmetries. </p><p>A useful trick is to write a wrapper that checks them:</p><blockquote><p>FourPi&lt;-function(i,j,k,l){<br/> 
   answer &lt;- FourPiInternal(i,j,k,l)<br/>   sym &lt;- FourPiInternal(j,i,k,l)<br/> 
   if (abs((answer-sym)/(answer+sym))&gt;EPSIL
