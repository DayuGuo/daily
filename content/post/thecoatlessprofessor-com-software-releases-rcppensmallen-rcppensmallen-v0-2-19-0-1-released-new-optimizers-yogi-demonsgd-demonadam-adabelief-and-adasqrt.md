description: |-
  The RcppEnsmallen package brings to R a Header-Only C++ Mathematical Optimization Library for Armadillo. In particular, Ensmallen is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library (by the MLPACK team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective function to optimize.
  In the second update of 2022, the Ensmallen Development Team has focused on adding new optimizers to the underlying package. Newly added optimizers are: AdaBelief, AdaSqrt, Yogi, DemonSGD, and ...
