  <p>Abstract:<br />
  Traditionally, the usual solution to reduce parameter dimensionality in the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model is through expert judgment. However, this approach may lead to lower efficiency and substantial bias in parameter estimates. The purpose of this study is to propose a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) algorithm to ascertain which parameters in a PBPK model are non-influential, and therefore can be assigned fixed values to improved speed and convergence
