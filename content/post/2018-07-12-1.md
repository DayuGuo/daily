  his MATLAB code by using log_sum_exp and log1m tricks. The natural question he had
  was, &#8220;where do you learn this stuff?&#8221; I checked Numerical Recipes, but
  the statistical parts are actually pretty thin (at least in my 1994 edition). Do
  you know of any books/papers [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2018/07/12/learn-log_sum_exp-log1p-lccdf-numerical-analysis-tricks/\">Where
