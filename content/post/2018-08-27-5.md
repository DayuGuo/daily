  Around this time last year I ran a post on European football transfers, taking in the 2017/18 seasonâ€™s summer window. I got a bit of an itch to refresh this work when the 2018/19 window hit. The aforementioned itch led to me getting in too deep and scraping all major European league transfers going back to the year 2000, naturally.
  Here, I tell a short story about how this open data was built and showcases some visualisation pieces that utilised that effort.
