  If you’ve ever watched an Ocarina of Time 100% speedrun, or played the game yourself, you’ll probably know about Dampe. As a gravedigger in Kakariko graveyard, he’ll offer to dig up graves for you when you go to him as child Link to get a random treasure. If you’re mildly lucky, you’ll get enough rupees to try again. If you’re really lucky, you’ll get the heart piece.
  The latter is obviously part of the 100% definition of the game, so hundo speedruns sooner or later have to face dampe and gamble
