description: |-
  The RcppEnsmallen package brings to R a Header-Only C++ Mathematical Optimization Library for Armadillo. In particular, Ensmallen is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library (by the MLPACK team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective function to optimize.
  The fall update of the ensmallen library has been released by the Ensmallen Development Team. Within this release, we see improvements to gradient stability with the inclusion of a gradient clipping and norm scaling callback based on &ldquo;On the difficulty of training Recurrent Neural Networks&rdquo; ...
