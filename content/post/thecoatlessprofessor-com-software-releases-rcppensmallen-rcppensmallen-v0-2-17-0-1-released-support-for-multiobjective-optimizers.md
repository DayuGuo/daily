description: |-
  The RcppEnsmallen package brings to R a Header-Only C++ Mathematical Optimization Library for Armadillo. In particular, Ensmallen is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library (by the MLPACK team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective function to optimize.
  Coming in right after the Fourth of July, we have the second minor release from Ensmallen Development Team. This release contains work done by Nanubala Gnana Sai, who worked extensively on a framework for Multiobjective Optimizers during Google Summer of Code ...
