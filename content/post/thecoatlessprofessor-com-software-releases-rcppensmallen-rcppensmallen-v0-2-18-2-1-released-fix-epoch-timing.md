description: |-
  The RcppEnsmallen package brings to R a Header-Only C++ Mathematical Optimization Library for Armadillo. In particular, Ensmallen is a templated C++ mathematical optimization library (by the MLPACK team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective function to optimize.
  The first update 2022 for the ensmallen library has been released by the Ensmallen Development Team. The release contains a minor bug fix for displaying timing output and an update to the underlying C++ unit testing ...
