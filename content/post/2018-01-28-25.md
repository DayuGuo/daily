description: This spectacular map from the National Geospatial-Intelligence AgencyÂ was
  circulating yesterday on Twitter. I got it from Christopher Jackson (@seis_matters).
  It shows antineutrino emissions from around the earth Our local (sub)continent of
  Zealandia shows up nicely at the bottom right. The black dots are nuclear reactors,
  and the dark smudge is just the immense rock mass [&#8230;]
