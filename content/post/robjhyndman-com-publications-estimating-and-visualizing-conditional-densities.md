description: We consider the kernel estimator of conditional density and derive its
  asymptotic bias, variance and mean-square error. Optimal bandwidths (with respect
  to integrated mean-square error) are found and it is shown that the convergence
  rate of the density estimator is order n-2/3. We also note that the conditional
  mean function obtained from the estimator is equivalent to a kernel smoother. Given
  the undesirable bias properties of kernel smoothers, we seek a modified conditional
  density estimator which has mean equivalent to some other nonparametric regression
  smoother with better bias ...
