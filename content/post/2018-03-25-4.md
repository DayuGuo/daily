description: 'This graph comes from the Twitter account of Jill Hennessy, Victoria&#8217;s
  Minister for Health.  It&#8217;s obviously intended to make a particular point &#8212;
  and one that&#8217;s politically supportive to her.  However, it&#8217;s actually
  a pretty good graph. The baseline isn&#8217;t zero, but this is clearly an example
  where a zero baseline would be silly: zero [&#8230;]'
