  <p>Scott Jaschik interviews Joli Jensen (link from Tyler Cowen), a professor of communication who wrote a new book called &#8220;Write No Matter What: Advice for Academics.&#8221; Her advice might well be reasonable&#8212;it&#8217;s hard for me to judge; as someone who blogs a few hundred times a year, I&#8217;m not really part of Jensen&#8217;s target audience.
