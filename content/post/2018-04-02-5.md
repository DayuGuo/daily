  <p>The NIH is soliciting input for their <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/NIH-Strategic-Plan-for-Data-Science.pdf">Strategic Plan for Data Science</a>. If you are interested, today, April 2, is the deadline. You can provide input <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=73">here</a>. Below is what I plan to  submit.</p>

  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

  <p>My main critique is that the report is somewhat vague. More specifics and concrete examples should be included.</p>
