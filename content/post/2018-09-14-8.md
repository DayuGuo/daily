description: Motivation I&rsquo;ve always being interested in Machine Learning and
  AI. I&rsquo;m just fascinated by machine intelligence, that you can train a &lsquo;machine&rsquo;
  with data and have it learn from the data. As usual, whenever I am interested in
  learning about a new field, I get on Coursera to find interesting courses about
  this field. I took the popular Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera,
  and it was by far one of the best courses I have taken in my life!
