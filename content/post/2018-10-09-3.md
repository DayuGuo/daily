description: "\n        \n        \n\n<p>Every R package has its story. Some packages
  are written by experts, some by\nnovices. Some are developed quickly, others were
  long in the making. This is the\nstory of <code>jstor</code>, a package which I
  developed during my time as a student of\nsociology, working in a research project
  on the scientific elite within\nsociology. Writing the package has taught me many
  things (more on that later)\nand it is deeply gratifying to see, that others find
  the package useful.</p>\n\n<p>"
