        <p><code>Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code> is the most unhelpful, brutal, ruthless &amp; savage error message thrown at my face.</p>

  <p>Another reason why working with c++ is not fun.</p>

  <p>Ouch.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>update</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After 2 hours of search/ debugging, it seems I&rsquo;ve get my first <strong>stack overflow</strong> !
  The lesson here is that I should not assign a large array on a stack.
  code :</p>

  <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

  using namespace
