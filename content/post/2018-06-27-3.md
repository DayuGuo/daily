        <p>This issue of Rstudio IDE has been reported for a while but has not been fixed.</p>

  <p>The issue is that in rstudio (&gt;=1.1), viewing wide or long data frame,matrix in the view panel feels clunky, but lower versions (such as 1.0.153) is much smoother. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Actually-I-am-ma"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:Actually-I-am-ma">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>Test code:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-r">test.mat &lt;- matrix(data=runif(2000000,0,1),nrow=20000,ncol=100)
