description: Many statistical methods involve summarizing a probability distribution

  selecting such a region is to require it to contain points of relatively high density.
  Highest density regions are particularly useful for displaying multimodal distributions
  and, in such cases, may consist of several disjoint subsets &mdash; one for each
  local mode. In this paper, I propose a simple method for computing a highest density
  region from any given (possibly multivariate) density f(x) which is bounded and
