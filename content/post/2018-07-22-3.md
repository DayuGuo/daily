          <p>Like Yihui (of blogdown and many other awesome R packages) whose goal is to publish a book a year<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I have a similar personal goal that I started last year. While I’d love to write a book a year, it’s too ambitious a goal for me (and many people in general, I’d think) to pursue. Instead, my personal goal is to do an external presentation a year, be it for meetups, conferences, or nearby schools as a guest speaker.</p>
