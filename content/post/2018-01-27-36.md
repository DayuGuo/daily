  <p>[image of Schrodinger&#8217;s cat, of course] Stan collaborator Michael Betancourt wrote an article, &#8220;The Convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo Methods: From the Metropolis method to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,&#8221; discussing how various ideas of computational probability moved from physics to statistics. Three things I wanted to add to Betancourt&#8217;s story: 1. My paper with Rubin [&#8230;]</p>
