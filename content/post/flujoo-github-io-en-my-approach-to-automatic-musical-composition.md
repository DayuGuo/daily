  In this blog, I will introduce my approach to automatic musical composition, including the theory, the algorithm, and a Python package implementation ch0p1n.

  As a trivial example, imagine that you put a cat on a piano to randomly press keys to generate music. The music is thus the result of a predetermined algorithm rather than of your instantaneous emotions or compositional ...
