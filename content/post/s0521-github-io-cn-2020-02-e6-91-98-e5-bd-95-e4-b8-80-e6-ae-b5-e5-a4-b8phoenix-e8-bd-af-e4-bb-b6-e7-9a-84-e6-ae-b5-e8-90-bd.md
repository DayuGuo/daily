  原文： Smith (2003) provides an overview of the nonlinear mixed effects model software packages. Two programs designed for pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic nonlinear mixed effects models include Pharsight’s Phoenix platform coupled to their NLME7 engine, and NONMEM (ICON Development Solutions). Phoenix-NLME has an advantage in that it was built for a Microsoft Windows environment, has all of WinNonlin’s built-in models, and has a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-built models. When the NLME ...
