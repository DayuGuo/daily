  <p>Today I attended the special panel discussion event at JHSPH called <a href="http://hopkinshumanitarianhealth.org/news-events/events/separated-child-separation-at-the-border-a-health-and-human-rights-perspect">“Separated: Children Separation at the Border A Health and Human Rights Perspective”</a>. It got my mind racing and here’s an idea. It’s likely (definitely) incomplete, but maybe it’ll get others to think on related ideas.</p>
