description: A geometric interpretation is developed for so-called reconciliation
  methodologies used to forecast time series that adhere to known linear constraints.
  In particular, a general framework is established nesting many existing popular
  reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation facilitates
  the derivation of novel results that explain why and how reconciliation via projection
  is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to a specific class of loss
  functions. The result is also demonstrated empirically.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ProfessorRob
