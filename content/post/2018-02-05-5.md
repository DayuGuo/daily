description: In a recent study, Bergmeir, Hyndman and Ben√≠tez (2016) successfully
  employed a bootstrap aggregation (bagging) technique for improving the performance
  of exponential smoothing. Each series is Box-Cox transformed, and decomposed by
  Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL); then bootstrapping is applied
  on the remainder series before the trend and seasonality are added back, and the
  transformation reversed to create bootstrapped versions of the series. Subsequently,
  they apply automatic
