   <p>The <a href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/td.html">td</a> package for accessing the <a href="https://www.twelvedata.com">twelvedata</a> API for financial data has been updated on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> to version 0.0.5.</p>
  <p>This is version is mostly the work of <a href="https://github.com/krose">Kenneth</a> who suggested to add accessors for reference data, and then did just that. So if you already use <a href="https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/td.html">td</a>, good news as you now have nine or so more functions getting data for you!</p>
