          <p>As much as I love using RStudio for everything<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, there are times when I can’t really use it, i.e., for some projects at work in which I need to log in to some servers and do work there (i.e., on the server side). Using RStudio server would do it, I think, but it’s not an option at the moment. For a long time, I’ve been trying to establish a good working data analysis workflow that I can follow in those situations.</p>
