description: The use of non-linear models in time series analysis has expanded rapidly
  in the last ten years, with the development of several useful classes of discrete-time
  non-linear models. One family of processes which has been found valuable is the
  class of self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) models discussed extensively
  in the books of Tong (1983, 1990). In this paper we consider problems of modelling
  and forecasting with continuous-time threshold autoregressive (CTAR) ...
