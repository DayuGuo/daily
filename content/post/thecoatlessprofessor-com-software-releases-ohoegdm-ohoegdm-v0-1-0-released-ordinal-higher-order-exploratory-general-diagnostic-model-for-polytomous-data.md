description: |-
  The ohoegdm package (CRAN, GitHub) is home to the implementation of ordinal exploratory Higher-order General Diagnostic Model (OHOEGDM) for Polytomous Data described by Culpepper and Balamuta (In Press). Through a focus on polytomous items with two or more response options, ohoegdm provides a novel method for inferring the latent structure using a higher-order model to describe dependence among the discrete latent attributes.
