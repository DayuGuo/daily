description: Presentation to MATRIX Workshop on Functional Data Analysis and Beyond
  Any good data analysis begins with a careful graphical exploration of the observed
  data. For functional time series data, this area of statistical analysis has been
  largely neglected. I will look at the tools that are available, and propose several
  new tools including functional ACF plots, functional spectrum plots, calendar plots,
  and embedded pairwise distance plots. These will be illustrated using mortality
  data from France, pedestrian count data in Melbourne, and smart metre data from
  Ireland.<img src="http://feeds.feed ...
